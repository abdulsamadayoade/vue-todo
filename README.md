# vue-todo
Vue-todo is a todo web app where users can type in their todo and also set a reminder. The todos are not saved/fetched on/from a server, so when a user refresh their browser, the todos will disappear. I intend to connect it to a backend such as firebase or supabase later on.

Users can:

1. Type in their todo
2. Set a reminder
3. Delete todo
